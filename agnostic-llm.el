;; Keywords: convenience, tools

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Drive an agentic CLI from Emacs.  Each project gets a dedicated
;; `*llm:PROJECT*' vterm; a multi-line prompt buffer with @file completion
;; feeds it, and a throwaway "bubble" streams a one-shot reply inline
;; without disturbing the main session.  `agnostic-llm-show-last-response'
;; renders the latest assistant turn from the session JSONL into a read-only
;; buffer.
;;
;; A transient menu (`agnostic-llm-menu') gathers the commands and exposes
;; per-invocation switches for model, reasoning effort, and skipping
;; permission prompts.  A FIXME/TODO annotation system records notes at
;; point, persists them (per-project under `.agnostic-llm/' or per-user
;; under `~/.cache/agnostic-llm/'), lists them, and can hand them back to
;; the LLM to resolve.
;;
;; Everything provider-specific — the CLI executable, its command-line
;; flags, the session-store layout, and the model/effort catalog — lives in
;; `agnostic-llm-providers', keyed by `agnostic-llm-provider'.  `claude' is
;; the default provider; add entries to drive other agentic CLIs (see
;; docs/multi-backend-design.org).
;;
;; Requires the active provider's CLI on PATH (the `claude' CLI by default).
;; Binds no global keys itself — bind the entry points (`agnostic-llm',
;; `agnostic-llm-menu', `agnostic-llm-prompt', ...) from your own
;; configuration.
